Practicing Flexbox with Tailwind

I iniitially followed a Brad Traversey tutorial on the basics of Flexbox at this URL; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YW65K6LcIA

Following completeing this, I wanted to test my hands at some TailwindCSS. 
So I decided to do my best at replicating the same layout (give or take a few pixels)
using TailwindCSS. I am pretty happy with how it turned out.
